        "The first few exercises will get you used to looking at the data using `pandas`. Pandas is a widely used library in python for manipulating data. Why? Datasets can consume a _lot_ of space in your computer's memory and traditional python data structures like lists or dictionaries will become painfully slow as we add thousands of rows of data. We use a specialized dataset library `pandas` which has a specialized data structure called a `dataframe` designed to be ultra fast & efficient.
